# Emotion Detection from Video using DeepFace & RNN (Generative AI Project)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Pallavi-NL/emotion-detection/blob/main/emotion_detection_project.ipynb)

Overview-
This project analyzes a video file to detect and visualize the emotional behavior of a person over time using DeepFace and RNN (LSTM).

Key Features-

- **Video Upload**: Analyze emotions from uploaded videos
- **DeepFace Emotion Recognition**: Detects 7 emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc.)
- **Graphical Emotion Trends**: Plots emotion scores over time
- **Captured Frame Display**: Visualizes detected emotions frame-by-frame
- **RNN Modeling**: Predicts emotional sequence using LSTM
- **PDF Report**: Generates downloadable summary report

Libraries Used-
- `deepface`, `tensorflow`, `opencv-python-headless`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `fpdf`

How to Use-
1. Click "Open in Colab" above 
2. Upload a video when prompted
3. Let the notebook analyze and visualize the results
4. Optionally download a PDF report

Sample Output-

> Emotion trends, captured frame collage, RNN predictions, and PDF generation

PDF Report Sample (once generated)-
- Total duration analyzed
- Dominant emotion
- Frequency of each emotion
- Behavior summary

Acknowledgments-
- Built using Google Colab, DeepFace, TensorFlow, and OpenCV
